## Selected topic: Automating Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit cards are now a ubiquitous part of daily life. As such the increased use comes with it the greater possiblity of fraud. Consumers need to feel confident in their use and in the bank's ability to detect and respond to fraudulent charges quickly.


Description of the source of data

"The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions."

# Questions to Answer
* Is there a way to detect credit card fraud based on:
  * Time of transaction
  * Amount of transaction
  * Store where the purchase was made

* Can this process be automated?





Machine Learning Model (35 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

Takes in data from the provisional database
Outputs label for input data


Database Integration (25 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
